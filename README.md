# C# Object-Oriented Console Application

This is an **object-oriented C# console application** developed as part of university coursework.  
The project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and encapsulation to model real-world entities and interactions in a structured and maintainable way.

## Features
- Implements object-oriented principles: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism where appropriate.
- Models real-world entities and their interactions using OOP concepts.
- Console-based user interface for interacting with the application.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (`autokereskedes.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project.
3. Run the application in the console to interact with the program.

## Technologies
- C# 
- Visual Studio

## Notes
- This is a **console application**, so all interactions occur through the terminal.
- Designed to demonstrate **object-oriented programming concepts** clearly and effectively.
